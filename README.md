## Roller Derby Introduction

Like Basketball, Roller derby is team sport with two teams of five players each. Unlike most team games, both teams are simultaneously playing offense and defense. The game is played on an oval track. Player are referred to as 'skaters'. One special skater for each team is the 'jammer', and she scores points by lapping members of the opposing team. Various rules conspire to keep non-jammer skaters - called 'blockers' - from moving as fast as the jammers, so the game becomes a full-contact sport rather than a speed skating contest. 

A note on language: although there are women's teams, men's teams, mixed-sex teams, and an inclusive policy towards accomodating people where they want to be placed on a gender spectrum, the reality is that roller derby is a woman-dominated sport. Thus, the traditional gender pronoun in talking about a skater is 'she'. The use of the term 'derby girl' or 'girl' to describe woman players is part of the culture - e.g. the local team is Derby City Roller Girls. To avoid confusion, girls (the non-women, non-adult type) playing roller derby seem to be referred to as 'Juniors'.
